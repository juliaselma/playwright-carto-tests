# 🗺️MANUAL TEST PLAN 🛠️:

This document details the Manual Test Cases required to validate the "Create Map Builder component in Workflows" initiative, ensuring compliance with product requirements.

---

## 1. General Information and Context ℹ️

Project: CARTO Workflows

Initiative/ComponentCreate: Map Builder

Objective: Verify that the component correctly generates maps, handles data division (positive/negative), displays clear metadata, and ensures updates with analytical results.

Scope: Functional ✅ , Interface (UI/UX 🎨), and Integration 🔗Testing of the Create Builder Map component.

---

## 2. Test Strategy 🧠

The strategy focuses on the component's functionality and its integration with the analytical workflow.

- ✅ Functional Testing: Validate the ability to create maps from two sources, apply filters, and generate result tables.

- 🔗 Integration Testing: Verify the persistence of the public URL and map updates when preceding nodes change.

- 🎨 UI/UX Testing: Ensure that metadata and source information are clear and accessible to the user.

## 3. Test Case Matrix 📋

### 🎯 Requirement 1:

Table Division and Map Creation

A user is able to create a map from two different sources using a filter table and generating a new table with only the rows of the input table that meet the filter criteria and another one with those that do not meet it.

---

#### 🧪TC-R1-001:

Positive Result (Meets Criteria):

Description:

Verify that the map only contains the rows that meet the criterion.

Steps:

1. Create Workflow with 2 sources (A and B).

2. Apply a filter (e.g., Value > X) between the sources.

3. Connect the positive output (Meets criteria) to the Create Builder Map.

4. Execute and open the map.

Expected result:

The map is successfully generated and only visualizes the rows that comply with the applied filter criterion.

---

#### 🧪TC-R1-002

Negative Result (Does Not Meet):

Description:

Verify that a table can be generated with the rows that do not meet the criterion.

Steps:

1. Configure the same previous Workflow.

2. Connect the negative output (Does not meet criteria) to an Output node (Data Explorer or similar).

Expected result:

The Output node generates a table that only contains the rows that DO NOT comply with the filter criterion.

---

### 🎯 Requirement 2:

Clarity of Data Reference (Metadata)

A user must have a clear reference to the data information of the Create Builder Map.

---

#### 🧪TC-R2-001

Description:

Key Metrics Visualization.

Steps:

1. Select the Create Builder Map node after execution.
2. Review the information in the configuration panel (or "Data" tab).

Expected results:

The fields ROWS COLS (Number of Rows and Columns) and updated at (Last Update Date) must be visible and display correct values.

---

#### 🧪TC-R2-002

Access to Information Tabs.

1. Select the Create Builder Map node.

Expected result:

The Results, Messages, Data, Map, and SQL tabs must be present and functional for the user.

---

#### 🧪TC-R2-003

Description:

Clear Error Messages (UI).

Steps:

1. Connect a data source lacking a geometry column to the component (provoking an error).
2. Review the preview and the "Messages" panel.

Expected result:

A clear and useful error message indicating the cause (e.g., "Couldn't find geometry column") must be displayed.

---

### 🎯 Requirement 3:

Persistence and Analytical Update

Requirement 3:

The user is able to ensure that the map stays up to date with the analytical results.

---

#### 🧪TC-R3-001

Description:

Update upon Logic Modification.

Steps:

1. Create a workflow (e.g., Stores in California).
2. Modify the filtering condition in a preceding node (e.g., change filter to "Nevada").
3. Execute the workflow.

Expected result:

The map generated by Create Builder Map must automatically update to reflect the new analytical results (stores in Nevada).

---

#### 🧪TC-R3-002

Description:

Public URL Persistence.

Steps:

1. Generate the map and obtain the public sharing URL.
2. Modify the workflow (e.g., add a new filter) and execute again.

Expected result:

The map at the original public URL must show the updated results, verifying that the URL is persistent and reflects the latest analysis.

---

## 4. Approval Criteria ✔️

All Test Cases marked as High/Critical Severity must have a Pass status.

The Create Builder Map component must ensure that the integration of map generation into the workflow functions as described, providing full control over how maps are generated and maintained.
