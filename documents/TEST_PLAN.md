# 🗺️MANUAL TEST PLAN 🛠️:

This document details the Manual Test Cases required to validate the "Create Map Builder component in Workflows" initiative, ensuring compliance with product requirements.

---

## 1. General Information and Context ℹ️

Project: CARTO Workflows

Initiative/ComponentCreate: Map Builder

Objective: Verify that the component correctly generates maps, handles data division (positive/negative), displays clear metadata, and ensures updates with analytical results.

Scope: Functional ✅ , Interface (UI/UX 🎨), and Integration 🔗Testing of the Create Builder Map component.

---

## 2. Test Strategy 🧠

The strategy focuses on the component's functionality and its integration with the analytical workflow.

- ✅ Functional Testing: Validate the ability to create maps from two sources, apply filters, and generate result tables.

- 🔗 Integration Testing: Verify the persistence of the public URL and map updates when preceding nodes change.

- 🎨 UI/UX Testing: Ensure that metadata and source information are clear and accessible to the user.

---

## 3. Test Case Matrix 📋

### 🎯 Requirement 1:

Table Division and Map Creation

A user is able to create a map from two different sources using a filter table and generating a new table with only the rows of the input table that meet the filter criteria and another one with those that do not meet it.

---

### 🎯 Requirement 2:

Clarity of Data Reference (Metadata)

A user must have a clear reference to the data information of the Create Builder Map.

---

### 🎯 Requirement 3:

Persistence and Analytical Update

Requirement 3:

The user is able to ensure that the map stays up to date with the analytical results.

---

#### 🧪TC-1	Full Workflow: Positive Result (Data, Metadata & Map)

Positive Result (Meets Criteria):

Description:

Verify that the end-to-end workflow correctly generates a map from data meeting a specific spatial criterion. This includes validating data integrity, key metadata metrics in intermediate and final nodes, and the final map output.

Steps:

1. Create Workflow with retail_stores and usa_states_boundaries datasets.

2. Configure a Simple Filter to select the geometry for the state of California.

3. Connect the match output of the Simple Filter to the filter input of the Spatial Filter.

4. Connect retail_stores to the source input of the Spatial Filter.

5. Execute the workflow.

6. Select the Spatial Filter node and review key metadata (Rows, Cols, Updated At).

7. Connect the match output of the Spatial Filter to the Create Builder Map.

8. Execute the Create Builder Map node and review key metadata.

9. Open the map in a new tab.

Expected result:

A. Data Validation: The result table for the Spatial Filter contains rows that spatially intersect with California (Validation: the state column must contain 'CA' and the test is currently set to tolerate the known data bug 'NV').

B. Metadata (R2): The Spatial Filter and Create Builder Map nodes must display the ROWS, COLS, and updated at metrics as visible and correctly populated.

C. Map Output: The map is successfully generated and only visualizes the filtered points of sale.

---

#### 🧪TC-2	Full Workflow: Negative Result (Data Exclusion)

Negative Result (Does Not Meet):

Description:

Verify that the workflow can correctly isolate and process data that DOES NOT meet the spatial criterion, validating data exclusion and metadata integrity.


Steps:

1. Configure the same previous Workflow (Simple Filter on California).

2. Connect the output unmatch of the Simple Filter to the filter input of the Spatial Filter.

3. Execute the workflow.

4. Select the node Spatial Filter and review key metadata.

5. Connect the match output of the Spatial Filter to the Create Builder Map.

6. Execute the Create Builder Map node and review key metadata.

Expected result:

A. Data Validation: The result table for the Spatial Filter contains rows that DO NOT intersect with the geometry of California (Validation: the state column must exclude 'CA').

B. Metadata (R2): The Spatial Filter and Create Builder Map nodes must display the ROWS, COLS, and updated at metrics as visible and correctly populated.

C. Map Output: The map is successfully generated and visualizes points of sale outside the California area.

### 🎯 Requirement 3:

Persistence and Analytical Update

Requirement 3:

The user is able to ensure that the map stays up to date with the analytical results.

---

#### 🧪TC-R3-001

Description:

Update upon Logic Modification.

Steps:

1. Create a workflow (e.g., Stores in California).
2. Modify the filtering condition in a preceding node (e.g., change filter to "Nevada").
3. Execute the workflow.

Expected result:

The map generated by Create Builder Map must automatically update to reflect the new analytical results (stores in Nevada).

---

#### 🧪TC-R3-002

Description:

Public URL Persistence.

Steps:

1. Generate the map and obtain the public sharing URL.
2. Modify the workflow (e.g., add a new filter) and execute again.

Expected result:

The map at the original public URL must show the updated results, verifying that the URL is persistent and reflects the latest analysis.

---

## 4. Approval Criteria ✔️

All Test Cases marked as High/Critical Severity must have a Pass status.

The Create Builder Map component must ensure that the integration of map generation into the workflow functions as described, providing full control over how maps are generated and maintained.
