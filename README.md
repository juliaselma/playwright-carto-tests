# üöÄ Playwright CI/CD Testing Project

This project contains a robust automation testing suite using Playwright for both User Interface (UI) and API layer validation. The tests are automatically executed via GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

## üìã Test Suite Description

The project is structured to be stable, modular, and easy to maintain, clearly separating UI and service tests.

- UI Tests (tests/ui/): Contains end-to-end (e2e) test cases that simulate user interactions within the browser (e.g., login, navigation). It utilizes a Page Object Model (POM) pattern.

- API Tests (tests/api/): Contains tests that validate API endpoints. It features a modular structure using Custom Playwright Fixtures for efficient authentication and centralized routes (apiEndpoints.ts) for simplified maintenance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Local Execution

To install and run the tests locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites
   Ensure you have Node.js (version 20 or higher) and npm installed.

2. Dependency Installation
   Navigate to the project root and install all Node.js dependencies, including Playwright and its browsers:

-Install all Node.js dependencies (package.json)

npm install

-Install Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

npx playwright install --with-deps

3. Environment Variable Setup
   This project uses a local .env file to handle secrets and credentials for local development.

#### Create a file named .env in the project root with your test credentials:

#### UI Credentials (used by UI tests)

USER_EMAIL= UI test credentials.

USER_PASSWORD= UI test credentials.

#### API Credentials (used by API tests)

USER_NAME="api.username"

PASSWORD="ApiTestPassword$"

4. Running the Tests

You can execute the entire test suite or specific subsets using Playwright commands:

üü¢ Run All Tests (UI + API)

npm run test

üåê Run Only UI Tests (Specific Browsers)

npm run test:ui:all

üîí Run Only API Tests

npm run test:api

5. Code Quality Checks

Run the following scripts to check and automatically format the code:

- Check and Fix Formatting (Prettier):

npm run format

- Check Linting (ESLint):

npm run lint

‚òÅÔ∏è Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

The tests are automatically executed via GitHub Actions under the Playwright Tests CI workflow whenever a push is made or a Pull Request is opened against the main or master branches.

- Quality Gate:

The workflow first runs lint and format checks. Tests only proceed if the code passes the quality inspection.

- Dependencies:

API tests are configured to run even if UI tests fail to ensure full coverage of the service layer.

- Security:

Credentials are set up as Repository Secrets in GitHub (UI_USER_EMAIL, API_USERNAME, etc.) and are securely injected into the CI virtual machine.

- Artifacts:

The workflow uploads Playwright HTML reports as separate artifacts, available for download in the Actions tab.
